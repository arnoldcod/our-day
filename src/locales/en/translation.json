        "HowWeMet_Paragraph": "We truly found love in a hopeless place... China. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, fate brought Arnold and Haven together while they were living in southern China. Though they had arrived for different reasons, their paths crossed quite unexpectedly..through a mutual friend. At the time, Haven was working as an English teacher in Shenzhen, while Arnold was studying computer science in Guangzhou. Despite the distance between cities, they felt an instant connection and began building a friendship that quickly blossomed into something deeper. Just five months after meeting, they officially began dating. From the beginning, Arnold had a strong sense about Haven, telling his friends, 'She‚Äôs wifey material.' Haven was drawn to Arnold‚Äôs thoughtful conversations and the way he challenged her thinking, encouraging her to reflect and grow.",

        "BuildingLifeTogether_Paragraph": "In 2022, a year into their relationship, Haven felt called to return to the United States. She quit her job, moved out of her apartment, and purchased three different plane tickets. But in a series of unexpected events, she wasn‚Äôt able to board any of them. It became clear that God had other plans. With nowhere else to go, she returned to Guangzhou..Arnold‚Äôs city.\n\nArnold stood by her side through it all, offering support as she navigated visa appointments, paperwork, and travel to multiple cities for documentation. Eventually, Haven found another teaching job in Guangzhou, which opened the door for them to live closer and deepen their relationship.\n\nTogether, they made the most of their time. They traveled across China, went to watch watch movies together, listened to music, tried new foods, and took long strolls through the city. They laughed with friends, watched NBA games, Premier League matches and worked out together. They went to church, built community, and created a rhythm that felt like home.\n\nThen in February 2023, life shifted again. Haven moved back to the United States..this time settling in Washington, D.C. while Arnold returned to Uganda after eight years in China. The long-distance chapter began. Despite being thousands of miles apart, they spoke every single day, across time zones and continents. At one point, with Haven in Seattle and Arnold still in Guangzhou, they navigated a 15 hour time difference yet never stopped showing up for each other.",

        "TheProposal_Paragraph":"Then came the most beautiful surprise.\n\nAt the end of 2023, Haven had a work assignment in Kenya , a country that held personal significance for Arnold. He had already decided that Kenya would be the place where he would ask Haven to marry him.\n\nOn December 15, 2023, Arnold proposed. It was a complete shock to Haven, who said yes through tears and joy. She had long prayed for a man like Arnold, and in that moment, she saw those prayers answered.\n\nSince then, they‚Äôve continued to walk through life hand in hand, even as life keeps evolving. Haven began a new chapter in Washington, D.C. and Arnold started an apprenticeship program to grow professionally. Together, they‚Äôve faced transitions, distance, and the unknown but never alone.\n\nThey give all glory to God, who has been the foundation of their relationship. It is His patience, strength, and grace that have sustained them through two years of long-distance love and continue to lead them into this next chapter, side by side.",
